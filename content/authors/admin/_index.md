I am an ESRC-funded PhD student in Economics at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). My research is cross-institutionally supervised by [Prof Andy Zapechelnyuk](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-andy-zapechelnyuk) (The University of Edinburgh), [Prof David A. Jaeger](https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/david-a-jaeger(edd24b23-7d88-4ef8-834e-46ea4d47c6a7).html) (University of St Andrews), and [Dr Min Zhang](https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/min-zhang(1e199ba1-7016-4e8e-83fb-43cc92d7caec).html) (University of St Andrews). I am specialising in the study of information design, with a keen interest in applying it to intellectual property. 

I was born and raised in Italy and hold a M.Sc. in Economics from the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and a M.A. (Hons) in Business Management and Economics from the [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/).

Prior to starting the PhD, I worked as a market analyst and economic researcher. In my spare capacity, I am eager to support [Rotaract](https://www.facebook.com/RotaractAberdeen/?locale=en_GB) and [Rotary](https://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/homepage.php?ClubID=3) initiatives.
