On October 10, 1949, Abele Waldemar of Baden, near Vienna, patented a construction toy made of round rods and clamping discs. Unlike earlier building sets with square rods, this design let rods be fixed at any angle, enabling more creative, free-form structures simple enough for children to build with ease.

Date of Application: 16 February 1948

Date of Issuance: 10 October 1949
