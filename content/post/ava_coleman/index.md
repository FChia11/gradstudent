On June 27, 1911, Ava R. Coleman of Palmyra, Virginia, patented a magnetic tilting-board game. Using irregularly rolling balls and a hidden, pivoting magnet that disrupted their paths, her design added mystery, challenge, and surprise to simple chance-and-skill play.

Date of Application: 24 October 1910

Date of Issuance: 27 June 1911
