On October 26, 1895, Lita, Baroness Putlitz of Retzin, Priegnitz, patented a combined pen or pencil box and T-square. Her design cleverly concealed a foldable T-square blade within the box’s double bottom, allowing schoolchildren to use it as both a writing supply case and a drawing instrument without carrying extra tools.
