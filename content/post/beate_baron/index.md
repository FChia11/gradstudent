On April 10, 1935, Beate Baron of Beuthen, Upper Silesia, received a patent for a ring- or arch-shaped mine support built from layered round timbers. The flexible structure could absorb heavy rock pressure without collapsing, making it well suited for tunnels, shafts, and related underground works.

Date of Application: 1 April 1933

Date of Issuance: 10 April 1935
