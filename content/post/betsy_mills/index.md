On October 17, 1907, Betsy Mills of Rochdale in the County of Lancaster invented an improved window sash in which the lower sash was hinged to open inward instead of sliding. This allowed the outside of the window to be cleaned safely from inside the house, while the upper sash continued to slide in the usual way.

Date of Application: 5 June 1907

Date of Issuance: 17 October 1907
