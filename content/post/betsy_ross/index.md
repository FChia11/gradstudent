On August 8, 1944, Betsy Ross of Stouchsburg, Pennsylvania, patented a process for making powdered, dehydrated vegetables — especially potatoes — that could be quickly rehydrated and kept a very high vitamin C content. The method cooked thin slices in hot oil, then removed it to produce a stable powder that stored well and was easy to use in soups.

Date of Application: 7 December 1943

Date of Issuance: 8 August 1944
