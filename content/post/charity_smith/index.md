On December 18, 1928, Charity Smith of Ithaca, New York, patented an improved “rag doll” design. Her method used specially shaped, pre-printed fabric patterns with dart seams to create natural curves at the elbows, knees, and neck — producing lifelike, easily made stuffed figures without the bulky gathers of earlier dolls.

Date of Application: 3 April 1893

Date of Issuance: 9 December 1893
