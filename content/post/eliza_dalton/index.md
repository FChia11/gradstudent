On October 6, 1894, Eliza Dalton, a gentlewoman of Argyle (New South Wales), obtained a patent for a novel device that let carts or carriages be oiled without removing the wheels or axle caps. Her design used a spring-loaded tube built into the axle cap: pulled forward with a key to fill with oil, then released to snap back into place, sealing the lubricant inside while the axle turned.

Date of Application: 18 June 1894

Date of Issuance: 6 October 1894
