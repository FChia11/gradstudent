On October 30, 1905, Francesca Myers of St. Kilda, Australia, patented an ornamental attachment for boots and shoes designed to cover and secure the knot and loose ends of laces. By fastening a bow, rosette, buckle, or similar decoration over the lacing, her device kept the ties from coming undone and added a decorative finish.
