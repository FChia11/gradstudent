On December 13, 1906, Gertrude Goad, a married woman of London, obtained a patent for a protective ladies’ motoring garment designed to shield travelers from cold, wet weather, and dust. Her design combined a double-breasted coat, mitten-style sleeves, a hood, and a sack-like lower section with built-in gaiters to keep the wearer warm, covered, and free to move.

Date of Application: 14 December 1905

Date of Issuance: 13 December 1906
