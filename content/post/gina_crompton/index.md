On October 27, 1908, Gina C. Crompton of Park City, Utah, patented a novel presser foot for sewing machines. Her invention featured a simple, low-cost design that made it easier to sew lace, piping, and braid without taking the machine apart, and let users work on the table instead of under the machine arm.

Date of Application: 27 October 1908
