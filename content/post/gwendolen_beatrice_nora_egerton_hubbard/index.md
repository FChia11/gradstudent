On April 17, 1923, English inventor Gwendolen Beatrice Nora Egerton Hubbard, then residing in Hollywood, California, obtained a patent for an educational toy made from just three simple shapes that could be combined to form any letter or numeral. By fastening these perforated pieces together, children could easily learn how characters were constructed without being overwhelmed by too many varied parts.
