On May 16, 1896, Gwladys Muriel Davies of Cardiff, Wales, patented an ingenious bottle designed to prevent refilling. Her design featured internal glass channels and a movable stopper that automatically sealed the bottle after use, ensuring it could only be filled once - a safeguard against tampering or reuse.

Date of Application: 11 April 1896

Date of Issuance: 16 May 1896
