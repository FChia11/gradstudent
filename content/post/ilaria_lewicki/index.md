On July 10, 1916, Ilaria Lewicki patented a novel extinguisher for cigarettes and cigars. Her invention featured two levers connected by a swivel joint, designed so that pressing the handles together caused one blade to pass sharply over the other. This motion crushed and pulled out the burning end of the cigar or cigarette, effectively extinguishing it without scattering ashes or producing excess smoke.

Date of Application: 22 January 1914

Date of Issuance: 10 July 1916
