On November 25, 1915, Ilaria Lewicki patented a novel trunk ring designed to prevent pigs from digging up crops or disturbing their beds. With its angular outer shape, the ring caused slight discomfort when pressed against the animal’s body, effectively discouraging both digging and pushing behaviour.

Date of Application: 22 January 1914

Date of Issuance: 25 November 1915
