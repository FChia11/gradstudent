On October 13, 1937, Jadwiga Stankiewicz of Poland patented a novel umbrella whose shaft could be offset from the centre of the canopy rather than placed centrally. By giving the rear portion of the canopy a larger span than the front, it could better protect the user's back from rain while remaining simple to construct using ribs of unequal length. 

Date of Application: 16 March 1936

Date of Issuance: 13 October 1937
