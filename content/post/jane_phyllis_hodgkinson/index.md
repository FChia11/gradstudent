On March 2, 1905, Jane Phillips Hodgkinson of Manchester patented a contoured abdominal belt designed to be worn beneath the corset. Made from alternating elastic gussets and stiffened textile sections, her belt was anchored by stocking-attached straps to prevent it from riding up — offering improved figure-shaping, greater comfort, and durability. 

Date of Application: 27 April 1904

Date of Issuance: 2 March 1905
