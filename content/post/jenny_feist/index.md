On May 29, 1897, Jenny Feist, a spinster of Wiesbaden, Germany, was awarded a patent for an improved tear-open envelope with perforated edges. By gumming the space between the perforations, her design prevented the letter inside from slipping into the tear line and being damaged when the strip was removed.

Date of Application: 27 April 1897

Date of Issuance: 29 May 1897
