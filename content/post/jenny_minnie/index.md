On May 29, 1897, Jenny Minnie of Haeltert, Belgium, patented an improved incubator with a simple hot-water heating system and built-in air channels. Circulating warm water kept the temperature even, while fresh air was drawn in and gently warmed before reaching the eggs, improving incubation reliability.
