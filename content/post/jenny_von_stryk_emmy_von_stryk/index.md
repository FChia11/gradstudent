On February 25, 1902, Jenny Von Stryk and Emmy Von Stryk of Arras, Russia, were granted a U.S. patent for a device to clean and disinfect toilet seats automatically after use. Linked to the flush handle, the mechanism sprayed a volatile disinfectant onto the seat while a moving brush wiped it clean, reducing the risk of contagion.

Date of Application: 16 October 1901

Date of Issuance: 25 February 1902
