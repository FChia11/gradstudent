On August 25, 1921, Linda Karpellus of Vienna, Austria, patented a simple assembly game in which children could create different faces by attaching interchangeable sheet-metal or cardboard features to a head-shaped base. The game used pins and matching holes so the parts fit easily, allowing quick, creative combinations without needing the pieces to align perfectly.

Date of Application: 14 July 1919

Date of Issuance: 25 August 1921
