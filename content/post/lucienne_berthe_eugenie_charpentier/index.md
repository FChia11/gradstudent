On October 3, 1912, Mademoiselle Lucienne-Berthe-Eugénie Charpentier of Côtes-du-Nord, France, patented a corset featuring an integrated elastic abdominal belt. Her design used two stretchable front panels that laced independently at the sides, allowing firmer support of the abdomen - particularly for fuller figures - while leaving the rest of the corset constructed in the usual manner. 

Date of Application: 15 May 1912

Date of Issuance: 3 October 1912
