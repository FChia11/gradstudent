On October 29, 1923, Madame Lucienne Frey of Châlons-sur-Marne, France, patented a new treatment for transmission belts. Her method improved belt grip by applying two separate coatings: an adhesive film on the pulley side and a conditioning grease on the reverse. Rather than functioning as a glue, the adhesive formed an elastic layer that conformed to the pulley’s surface, greatly increasing friction and reducing slippage compared with untreated leather.

Date of Application: 6 February 1923

Date of Issuance: 29 October 1923
