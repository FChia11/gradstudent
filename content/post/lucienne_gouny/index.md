On October 30, 1919, Madame Lucienne Gouny of Paris, France, patented a collapsible box using a parallelogram folding system. Her design hinged all sides so that two opposite sides remain parallel while the others fold without overlap, allowing the box to compact to one-quarter of its full volume when closed.  

Date of Application: 25 February 1919

Date of Issuance: 30 October 1919
