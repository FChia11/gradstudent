On June 30, 1925, Lucilla de Vescovi of New York patented a lightweight, low-cut brassiere that combined multiple undergarments — such as a vest, teddy, or knickers — into a single, supportive article. The garment used elastic straps and overlapping fasteners to hold its position securely, while allowing full freedom of movement. 

Date of Issuance: 30 June 1925
