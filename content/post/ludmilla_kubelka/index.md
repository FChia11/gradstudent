---
On August 15, 1911, Ludmilla Kubelka of Vienna patented a new method to secure natural or artificial hair directly into hardening pulp. Using a small hooked tool, tufts of hair were pulled through the material and fixed on the inside, creating realistic, pore-like roots with a much stronger grip than glued-on wigs.

Date of Application: 12 July 1910

Date of Issuance: 15 August 1911
