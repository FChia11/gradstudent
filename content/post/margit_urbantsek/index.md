On April 12, 1910, Margit Urbántsek of Budapest first patented a novel method for ornating piled fabrics. Her invention featured a socket-shaped iron that could be easily interchanged without tools or delay, allowing users to apply different patterns with speed, precision, and safety—unlike previous methods that required unscrewing hot components.
