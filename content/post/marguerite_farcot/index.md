On June 24, 1911, Madame Marguerite Farcot, n√©e d'Albaret, a French national, was granted a patent for a high-power multi-cylinder engine designed for aviation. Her invention featured a stationary support shaft around which the cylinders rotated, interlocking at their base to form a central casing. By mounting each cylinder on the polygonal faces of a drum, the design allowed for a remarkably simple yet efficient engine, with cylinders that could be entirely machined on a lathe.

Date of Application: 20 July 1910

Date of Issuance: 24 June 1911
