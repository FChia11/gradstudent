On November 12, 1914, Mary Audrey Harper Mitchell of Weston Grange, near York, patented a novel device for keeping a blouse and skirt aligned at the back. It used a waist belt with a flexible, rib-reinforced back shield fitted with small fasteners, allowing the blouse to be held neatly down while the skirt was securely hooked in place above it.

Date of Application: 4 February 1914

Date of Issuance: 12 November 1914
