On November 14, 1950, Oak L. Ritter of San Francisco patented a duck toy that waddled, opened its beak, and wagged its tail when pulled. A spring made it “quack,” which could be turned off, and guards kept children’s fingers safe. 

Date of Application: 26 December 1947

Date of Issuance: 14 November 1950
