On August 14, 1919, Olympia de Mendonca Cortez and Eliza de Menezes, two spinsters of Lisbon, patented a faster, more economical way to make raised-relief maps. Their method printed the whole map first, then embossed it all at once over a layered die, using grouped contour pieces and durable electrotypes to speed production.
