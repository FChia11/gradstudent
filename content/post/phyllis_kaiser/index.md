On September 22, 1931, Phyllis C. Kaiser of Bervely Hills, California, patented a simple adhesive-tape device to prevent children from sucking their fingers. By wrapping the tape around the digit to create small, outward-projecting tabs that felt unpleasant in the mouth, her design discouraged the habit while allowing normal finger movement.

Date of Application: 23 October 1929

Date of Issuance: 22 September 1931
