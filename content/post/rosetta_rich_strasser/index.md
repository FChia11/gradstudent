On March 21, 1933, Rosetta Rich Strasser of New York patented a novel covering designed to prevent discoloration and odors on the fingers used to hold a cigarette. Her design ranged from simple twin-finger sheaths to adjustable versions that gripped the cigarette more securely, offering women a clean, discreet way to smoke without staining their hands.

Date of Application: 25 July 1931

Date of Issuance: 21 March 1933
