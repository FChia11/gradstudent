On March 30, 1920, Sofia Haag of Fort Sheridan, Illinois, obtained a patent for a lightweight, portable hand-loom designed to let inexperienced or bedridden users weave fabric by hand. Her system allowed the warp threads to shift and form different sheds, making it possible to create patterned weaves (e.g., twill, herringbone, or diamond) without the complexity of traditional looms.

Date of Application: 10 November 1919

Date of Issuance: 30 March 1920
