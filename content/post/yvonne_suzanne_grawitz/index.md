On March 20, 1912, Yvonne-Suzanne Grawitz of Montpellier, France, patented a novel method for producing color stereoscopic images. By photographing each half of a stereo pair through complementary color filters (e.g., red and green) and viewing them through matching filters, her system allowed the final image to appear both three-dimensional and in its natural colors.

Date of Application: 7 July 1911

Date of Issuance: 20 March 1912
