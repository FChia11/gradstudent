abstract: I study the impact of the UK voluntary front-of-pack nutritional labelling (FOPNL) system on e-grocery consumer ratings and reviews. Using data from Tescoâ€™s online platform, I proceed in two steps: first, I transform reviews into real-valued vectors to cluster similar products into thematic classes. I exploit this representation to assess whether higher ratings and reviews positively correlate to healthier food bundles (i.e. lowest scoring in terms of percentage reference intakes \[RIs\]). From this analysis, I (expect to) find a negative pattern. To improve the quality of pre-purchase information disclosure, I then train an e-consumer-reviewer (\textit{agent}) to control the rating level. I provide evidence that the trained agent can converge to an optimal review level according to the FOPNL system. I discuss how reviewers can improve consumer welfare and provide ratings compatible with nutritional labelling. Finally, I raise limitations and ethical concerns related to this research.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  Can online reviews and ratings help predict nutritional quality? Do e-grocery product reviews convey messages compatible with the FOPL system? If not, how can governments regulate this space more effectively?
