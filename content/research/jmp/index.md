# Abstract
abstract: "Patenting at the United States Patent and Trademark Office has traditionally been dominated by large entities. In an effort to mitigate this disparity, Congress recently introduced reforms aimed at lowering patenting costs for small businesses. Although these measures appear beneficial, they remain contested: existing studies indicate that fee reductions can raise filing volumes while diminishing patent quality. Importantly, this critique is derived almost exclusively from analyses of large firms, leaving evidence on the implications for smaller businesses scarce and qualitative in nature. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the impact of lower fees on smaller inventors. In March 2013, the America Invents Act introduced a new fee discount for micro entities. Using small firms as controls, I use a matched difference-in-difference design to verify whether lower fees affected the outcome and quality of applications filed by the treated group. The evidence shows that, post-reform, micro entities significantly reduced the quality of their applications and were 37.36-percentage-point less likely to be granted a patent. While effects are stable across individual characteristics, large universities and private firms were worst affected by the provision. The impact is persistent and spills over to patent continuation, pointing to important consequences for strategic patenting. By retrospectively examining the effects of lower fees on micro entities, this research aims to draw practical implications for the design of future statutory fees."
